#### **Assignment : Todo-List**

#### **Result:** Take a look at this project: https://todo-list-ac2556.netlify.app/

## Description

For this assignment I created a todo list linked to a *RESTful-API.*
Partly because of this, it is possible to do the usual requests such as: **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE** to maintain the tasks of the todo list

## Requirements:
>- As a user I want to see an input field in which I can fill in my task.
>- As a user I can press a button with the text "Add Task" which will add your completed task to the list.
>- As a user, when I clicked the add button button, I see the task appear in my task list.
>- Delete task: As a user, I can click on a trash can icon in the task list to the right of the task, which removes the task from my task list.

## API requirements:
>- GET: Get the (initial) list of tasks from the database.
>- POST: Update the task list with 1 new task. Only send {description: "blah", done: false}
>- DELETE: Delete a job from the database. Use the id that you get back as an identifier.
>- Create a file called api-client.js as you have learned in recent times for all your requests.

## Bonus Requirements
>- Cross out task: As a user, I can click on a checkbox in the task list to the left of the task, so that the text of the task is crossed out and I can check off my task.
>- As a user I want to be able to click on my task and edit the text.
>- Additional API requirements (related to the above): - PUT: update an existing task the property done or not done. - PUT: update and existing task with the PUT method.
